The data consist of projectd shoot ereas (PSA) for 89 lines of TEJ(Temperate japonica) measured
on 20 time points(1-20 days) after planting(Pheno.txt).
Realized genome-wide relationship among 89 lines computed using Vanraden approach(2008) by 
36,901 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), so the G matrix has 89*89 dimension (G.txt).
